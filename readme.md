# Smart Deployer

Smart Deployer is a universal solution for organizing and managing paid smart contract deployments.

ðŸ“š [Contracts documentation](https://solidityuniversity.github.io/smart-deployer/book/)  
ðŸŽ“ [Solidity Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.solidity.university)

ðŸ§¾ Every contract in this repository is fully documented using NatSpec â€” including deployment instructions, configuration details, and extensibility tips. Developed by Solidity University, following best practices and released under the MIT license, allows developers to:

- Deploy your own `DeployManager.sol`
- Create & connect utility contracts using [template](https://github.com/SolidityUniversity/smart-deployer/blob/main/src/UtilityContract/AbstractUtilityContract.sol)
- Monetize the deployment of utility contracts
- Enable\disable contracts, fees any time
